1. OS concepts – virtual memory, paging, process states, paging algos.
2. float to string
3. Given the inorder and preorder traversals of a Binary Tree, output the postorder traversal of it.
4. To prove that the time complexity of inserting n elements in a heap.
5. Implement LRU
6. combinatorics: Given a matrix (m*n), source (0, 0) & destination (m-1, n-1) (i.e. last cell), Find out total number of ways to reach the destination from the source.
7. Given two sorted arrays, create a final sorted array. Later, the problem was extended saying that, now we have ‘m’ number of sorted arrays each of size ‘n’, now efficiently create a final array. A lot of discussion was done on complexity of the approach (both time and space).
8. combinatorics. 3 of N, etc
9. Given a string, find the longest substring which is palindrome. For example, if the given string is “forgeeksskeegfor”, the output should be “geeksskeeg”.
10. KMP pattern matching
11. Given a number N, find the smallest 3 digits number  such that product of its digits is equal to N.
12. Trie
13. Lock variable and their implementation (OS)
