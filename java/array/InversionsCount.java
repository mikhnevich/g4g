 * Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion n is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion n is the maximum.
 Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j

 Example:
 The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
