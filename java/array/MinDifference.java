/*
Find the least difference between any two elements of an integer array.

First we can sort the elements of the array. Then we can iterate over the array and find difference between
consecutive elements. The least of them would be the least differences between any two elements of the array.
The complexity will be O(nlogn) because of the sorting step.


Using k-th statistics algo: get 1st and node-th elements - O(node)
