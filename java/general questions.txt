    Hint: There is no restriction on placing nodes. You can remove any node from any place and put it in any place.
    I devised an algorithm which will make use of two lists. One list contains nodes far away from the root and this is sorted in decreasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level. Other list contains nodes which are not fully filled. This is sorted increasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level .
    Remove the first node (listed in list1) and insert as a child of first node in list2.add this node also in list 2. Do this operation until the height of the tree becomes log(n). Interviewer was impressed with this and finished the interview.

60. You are given an array in which you’ve to find a subarray such that the sum of elements in it is equal to zero.
    time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n)

    hash the sum from 0 to i for all array elements, i.e sum[i] = sum of all elements from a[0] to a[i] and corresponding index as data to key (starting from -1 to n)

    ex: 2 3 -4 9 -1 -7 -5 6 5

    sum to enter in hash table : 0 2 5 1 10 9 2 -3 3 8
    index to enter in hash table: -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

    hash sum as key and its corresponding index as data. and while hashing check if any sum is already exists in hash table

    here there is one duplicate number that is 2 in sum array... the indexes of duplicate numbers is 0 and 5, so we need to take sum from index 1 to 5 in original array that is 3 to -7

    if there are no duplicates in sum array then sub-array with sum ZERO doesn't exists in given array
    ------------
    Found in Stackoverflow:

    This algorithm will find all subarrays with sum 0 and it can be easily modified to find the minimal one or to keep track of the start and end indexes. This algorithm is O(n).

    Given an int[] input array, you can create an int[] tmp array where tmp[i] = tmp[i - 1] + input[i]; Each element of tmp will store the sum of the input up to that element.

    Now if you check tmp, you'll notice that there might be values that are equal to each other. Let's say that this values are at indexes j an k with j < k, then the sum of the input till j is equal to the sum till k and this means that the sum of the portion of the array between j and k is 0! Specifically the 0 sum subarray will be from index j + 1 to k.

    NOTE: if j + 1 == k, then k is 0 and that's it! ;)
    NOTE: The algorithm should consider a virtual tmp[-1] = 0;
    NOTE: An empty array has sum 0 and it's minimal and this special case should be brought up as well in an interview. Then the interviewer will say that doesn't count but that's another problem! ;)
    The implementation can be done in different ways including using a HashMap with pairs but be careful with the special case in the NOTE section above.

    Example:

    int[] input = {4, 6, 3, -9, -5, 1, 3, 0, 2}
    int[] tmp = {4, 10, 13, 4, -1, 0, 3, 3, 5}
    Value 4 in tmp at index 0 and 3 ==> sum tmp 1 to 3 = 0, length (3 - 1) + 1 = 4
    Value 0 in tmp at index 5 ==> sum tmp 0 to 5 = 0, length (5 - 0) + 1 = 6
    Value 3 in tmp at index 6 and 7 ==> sum tmp 7 to 7 = 0, length (7 - 7) + 1 = 1
    UPDATE

    Assuming that in our tmp array we end up with multiple element with the same value then you have to consider every identical pair in it! Example (keep in mind the virtual '0' at index '-1'):

    int[] array = {0, 1, -1, 0}
    int[] tmp = {0, 1, 0, 0}
    By applying the same algorithm described above the 0-sum subarrays are delimited by the following indexes (included):

    [0] [0-2] [0-3] [1-2] [1-3] [3]

    Although the presence of multiple entries with the same value might impact the complexity of the algorithm depending on the implementation, I believe that by using an inverted index on tmp (mapping a value to the indexes where it appears) we can keep the running time at O(n).

61. A skeleton of a binary tree with nodes having garbage values is given and an array is given. Had to fill up the binary tree skeleton with the values in array such that the resulting tree is a BST.

68.  Given a String s and int r , first fill each character row wise and print column wise.

    so filling column wise would give :

    and final ans would be adgbehcf.

    Inputs: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL and k = 5
    Output: 5->4->3->2->1->8->7->6->NULL.
70. iteratively sum numbers represented by linked lists
71. Which data structure would you use to keep records of stock market?

    I asked him to clarify the problem statement.

    He then asked me : Suppose you have to maintain the stock values of various companies during various periods and return minimum stock value of a particular company over a given period of time.

    I answered segment tree (Probably the correct answer was queue data structure).
    However the interviewer proceeded with questions on segment tree.
    He asked me to write a code for
    a) Creating a segment tree
    b)	Performing range minimum query in a segment tree
    c) Updating the segment tree
    He asked me to analyze the time complexity for building the segment tree and performing the range minimum query in the segment tree.
    He then asked me: If you are to maintain the stock value of a company for the past 6 months..then you have to update the segment tree every day by deleting a stock value and inserting a new stock value. How would you do that?
    Here I got stuck and could not perform the updation in better than O(n) time.(However using queue it can be performed in O(1) time)

Now you can mix any two adjacent jars having colors ‘a’ and ‘b’ (both integers), and it will produce a new color of the value (a+b) mod 100 and will also produce smoke with value (a*b). Mix all the jars in a way such that in the end only one jar remains and total smoke produced is minimum.
