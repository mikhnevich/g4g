We have strings of format A_ _ _ _ _ _ _, an A followed by 6 spaces that can be a number 0-9. We also have regular expressions with the operations "or" and "*" defined as follows:. The easiest way to illustrate this is to give an example. "A000001 or A000000" has size 2 because it matches two strings. "*" represents a wild card, so A00000* has size 10 because it matches 10 different strings, (A000000 - A000009).
"A0* or A1*" has size 20,000 because it matches 20,000 different strings.
The question was this:
Write a function that takes in a number N and outputs a regular expression that matches exactly N strings of format A _ _ _ _ _ _.

(suppose you have a rectangle embedded on the plane, and a disk with the points contained within the rectangle.
If you randomly throw a fixed triangle into the rectangle, what is the probability all its endpoints are contained
within the circle?).

Suppose you have an array that's k-sorted, i.e. each element is only k indices away from its final sorted order.
Sort this array in O(k log n) time.
