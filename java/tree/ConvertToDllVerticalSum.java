 * Given a binary tree, each node having an integer data, the objective is to create a new Doubly Linked List using this binary such that each node in DLL has vertical sum of nodes in binary tree. The order of nodes in DLL shall be left to right as that of binary treeâ€™s vertical nodes i.e., leftmost vertical sum shall be 1st node in DLL and the rightmost vertical sum shall be the last node in DLL.
